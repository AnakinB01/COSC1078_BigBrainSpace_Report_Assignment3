              Our group BigBrainSpace worked very well on this assignment again. Similar to the last assignment 2 our teamwork is great, we had good communication skills and used our time efficiently working on and completing the project and the report. For this assignment 3 we have continued to use Microsoft Teams, Facebook Messenger, GitHub to communicate with each team member as we found that those methods were effective in the assignment 2.<br><br>
              The team did not have any major issues, everyone completed their parts but one slight problem is that not everyone will complete the work at the same time especially in the last few days, so we have to wait until everything is completed before finalising the submission.<br><br> The previous issue we had was planning the Microsoft Teams meetings, but in this assignment, the meeting schedules were improved and were able to get everyone on for the majority of meetings we have had and discuss our progress and agenda.<br><br> Something that can be improved on is the report writing, if we had more time we could have worked better focusing on both the creation of  artifacts and report writing.    
              One thing that I found surprising was that we never had any major problems with group members and our work and even though we lost a group member, we are still able to communicate efficiently and are able to get the extra work done. <br><br>What I have learnt about the group is that there are different types of people and their ways of doing the work, therefore, this was a good opportunity for me to be able to work with different people and gain experience for what is possibly like for our future jobs.

              Once again, for this assignment, the group worked very well together. The team used their time very efficiently while working on the report and the project.<br><br> We also had time in class to work together on the assignment and we held regular meetings during each week to complete the assignment on time. As compared to the last assignment two of our weaknesses were to have everyone attend the group meeting at the same time.<br><br> This was improved on in assignment three, where we had each team member follow the meeting schedule and attended the team meetings on time. We continued to use the same method of communication because we found that it worked very well.<br><br> The team distributed specific parts of the report and the website to members of the group and our roles were rotated throughout each week. This ensured that the report, website and prototype finishes on time. We continued to use the same tools such as MS teams, Google Docs, Facebook messenger, VS code, Github etc.<br><br> One thing that was surprising to me was that we didn’t have any major issues in the group. Although we had some minor issues in the first stages of the group, for example when we lost a member of the team and when we couldn't get everyone to attend the team meetings at the sametime.<br><br> However, we overcame this by scheduling group meetings afew days in advance based on everyone's availability during class meetings. One thing that could have been improved on could be the report. Due to the time constraints, we were unable to have produced a better written report and the best finished project.

              Our group ‘BigBrainSpace’ gelled quite well together, which really helped us complete the assignment at quite a fast pace, as we had less time to finish this assignment. The group showed great teamwork, and the communication between members of the group was even better this time around.<br><br> Despite having limited time, the group managed to efficiently split up the sections of the report, as well as manage the website and prototype. The weakness of the group from the previous assignment was addressed this time around, which led to improvements in those aspects.<br><br> This time around all the members of the group attended the meeting at the decided time, which was very crucial for this assignment as the work needing to be done was more and the time was very limited. This led to sections of the report, website and the prototype being finished on time. 
              One surprising thing about the group was that, despite having limited time, the group was able to complete all sections of the report, as well complete the website and create a working prototype.<br><br> Along with this a couple of times, members of the group couldn’t attend the meeting, but still completed the work we had assigned them during the call, and this was when communication proved to be key for this assignment.<br><br> One thing I have learned about the group is that, while members of the group seem to be quite laid back, they get the work done on time. Overall the assignment was a great experience especially with this bunch of people.

              Our group worked extremely well together for assignment 3. Likewise in assignment 2 we were able to communicate effectively and efficiently, discussing key points in meetings and not going off topic.<br><br> This allowed the group to keep on time, splitting the workload and completing the report and project. Such as with assignment 2, we continued to communicate through microsoft teams and facebook messenger for assignment 3 as it was effective. Alongside the communication the way the group was able to split up what needs to be done was quick and efficient, allowing for everyone to understand what part they needed to complete and evenly distribute the work. 

              <br><br>Things that I found surprising about our work as a group is how a majority of the we were able to complete our project and report smoothly without many issues, and how communication and division of workload was able to be handled without complaint even when down a group member.
              
             <br><br> One thing that I learned about groups and our group was how much faster completion of work can be done when executing proper communication between group members and how important it is to work to people’s advantages to help complete projects and reports quicker.

              The group, BigBrainSpace, which I am fortunate enough to be a part of has performed remarkably well over the course of this assignment. The way we interacted with one another and all members harnessed the ability to efficiently communicate with each other helped streamline the development process of this assignment.
              <br><br>The main strength that I found worked very well within this assignment was the ability for everyone to attend the meetings and improve on our possible lack of attendance from assignment 2. The way we efficiently communicated on Facebook Messenger, Microsoft Teams and our whole group contribution to the work held on Google Docs allowed us to progress smoothly through the assignment with no missing information. <br><br>An aspect that could be improved on is our detail in the written component (report). If we had more time we could have written a more thorough report.
              An aspect that was surprising was the minimal problems the group faced in relation to being a member down in the group.<br><br> We expected this could cause some issues in terms of time management and work delegation but we did not experience any issues and that goes to show how well we can work together.
              <br><br>Finally, what I have learned about groups is that we must adapt to everyone's strengths and weaknesses. Doing this allows a group to work productively and get the task completed on time. Sometimes you do not have a choice but communication is key and creating a detailed plan at the beginning of the assignment is crucial to success.

              Overall, BigBrainSpace has worked extremely well together on this assignment. Luckily, the team did not face any major issues throughout the assignments which we have undertaken. The team worked efficiently in the time given to submit the assignment.<br><br> This was performed well because we developed a timeline at the start of the assignment that included the tasks being broken down into sub sections. Also individuals were assigned to the specific tasks or we set time to work on the assignment together. 

              <br><br>We continued to use Microsoft Teams and Facebook messenger for communication. We have improved our meeting schedules and plans where everyone is able to join a meeting together for the majority of meetings whereas, in assignment 2 we had minor issues with planning a suitable meeting schedule for everyone.<br><br> An aspect that could be improved is the report writing, it is a lot of work to try and create the best project artifacts and aim to have outstanding report writing at the same time. We believe that, if we had more time we could have spent more time developing our project artifacts and would have written a more thorough and higher quality report.
              
              <br><br>The surprising thing about the group was that whilst we had a lot to complete within this assignment with very limited time and even though we had some issues in assignment 2 with a group member leaving, the group worked quite well together and completed all the tasks which needed to be finished, along with that also completed the website, and the prototype, that to without facing any major problems with any of the sections. All the members of the group worked equally to complete the assignment.
              
              <br><br>The one thing we learned from this assignment as a group, was that it is really important for everyone to attend the meetings, and to complete all allocated work well before the due date. By doing this in assignment 3, we were able to be more productive achieving more in a very short amount of time. Another thing that was learnt from this assignment was that in order for the project and report to be complete at high standards we had to work to people’s strengths such as having a person with a deep understanding of html and css to more focus on creating the website for our project then to have them work on other things in the project. 
              
              <br><br>We didn’t have a github activity log however we used visual studio code to create the website and combined it as one, instead of an activity log we followed the timeline instead. We used visual studio code instead as we believed it was more convenient where we were able to view the whole project as a whole instead of just the website.
