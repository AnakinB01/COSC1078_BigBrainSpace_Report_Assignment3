      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to allow clients to view or inspect the
        property they are either looking to purchase or are building from
        scratch. The accomplishment of this project will create a new
        opportunity for real estate agencies to conduct inspections for clients
        purchasing properties which might be at a distance from their current
        location. <br><br> Along with that it will allow clients to view their property
        before it’s even made if they are constructing a property. People
        building their own new property or home from scratch will be able to
        send their floor plan to the website where a model of their property
        will be made in which they will be allowed to view before finalising and
        getting the property to be constructed. <br><br>Real estate agencies will be
        able to receive models of properties they are selling and display them
        to clients wishing to purchase while not having to physically be at the
        property. With the success of this idea we look to increase the
        convenience for property buyers and builders and because the real estate
        market is in full flow at the moment, this can be a revelation in the
        real estate industry.

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the recent events of Covid-19 and the hussle of our clients, we
        are motivated to create a Virtual house and interior option that can be
        viewed providing a fully immersive experience like going to the physical
        location. <br><br>Due to the travel limits and no house inspections running at
        the time, our clients found it difficult to make a decision regarding
        the purchase of the property. This also provides efficiency in general,
        this will save time for clients as they will not be required to travel
        long distances.<br><br> Another reason to do this project is because with the
        low interest rate announced by the RBA, more Australians are looking to
        take advantage of this and are purchasing properties, which is also
        reflected in the price rise, therefore this project will be very
        attractive as it fits right in with the trend.

      <h2>Landscape</h2>
      <p>
        Similar systems or products include websites that allow you to create
        your own floor plans and interior designs however, our idea is different
        as our project allows clients of Real Estates to be able to experience
        real life houses anywhere in a virtual environment. Where users are able
        to provide a floor plan and architects and designers will create a
        virtual house for them that will represent the real property.<br><br> What
        differentiates us from other applications and competitors is that we act
        as the ‘middle-man’ in the virtual experience for commercial and
        residential properties. The floorplanner application for example,
        requires users to create the interior designs and renderings from
        scratch, meaning this consumes the time of the customer or real estate
        agent listing and displaying the renderings and property to clients as
        they have to develop the design. <br><br>What we will do and what sets us apart
        from the other application is that we use an architectural plan or
        current property to design the VR Model in floorplanner without having
        the Real Estate Agency/ Property Developer making it, then we can
        display these renderings through our web based application where the
        users can view their models in VR.
