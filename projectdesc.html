      <h2>1) Create a VR Property Application (Main Aim)</h2>
      <p>
        Our main aim as a group for the propertyVR application is to develop
        unique and custom property models from pre-designed floor plans
        submitted to us from clients of our application. <br><br>We intend to gather the
        property floor plan from the client through an online submission process
        via our web application, then once we acquire the floor plan, we can
        render a 3D model of the property with full and custom furnishing to the
        clients desire.<br><br> This model will attain the capability to be viewed
        virtually anywhere through VR headset applications and also on PC and
        mobile if VR is not available. We intend to redistribute our modelling
        of the property back to the client via our web based application.<br><br> We
        also aim to have full customizable interactions with the client and a
        revision based system where clients can revise their models and request
        to change furnishings, colour schemes etc.

      <h2>1) Create a VR Headset Model</h2>
      <p>
        One of the goals of our project is to create a fully rendered Virtual
        Reality headset for the Real Estates to use to view and experience our
        virtual interior models.<br><br> The goal for the 3D headset model is to create
        a minimalistic design on the software Blender. Our goal is to first
        create the basic unrendered model of the headset that will provide the
        headset itself but with no colours or textures.<br><br> Then our goal is to use
        that headset as a base to further develop and implement the correct
        textures, colours for the headset and once that is completed we will
        adjust the lighting and camera angles for the final rendered 3D model.

        2) Create a responsiveness and features to improve overall client

      </h2>
      <p>
        Also contained within the set of goals for our project is one to develop
        a responsive web based application hosted online that processes all our
        clients information and interactions with our end products and
        first-step enquiries.<br><br> The application needs to be fully responsive which
        does not limit the user to access through a larger viewport such as a
        desktop computer, rather they can access through smaller form factors
        such as mobile phones. This will increase our user friendliness and
        client interaction.<br><br> The application also needs to be secure and free
        from threats and unwanted access as we are handling private floor plans
        and client information. One more sub-goal of this overarching main goal
        is to create an aesthetically pleasing site that is accessible for users
        and is pleasing to visit.<br><br> We hope this will provide us with returning
        customers and further recommendations as the site is easy to use and it
        gets the task at hand achieved without a complexity of steps.

      <h2>3) Create the property 3D Model for VR</h2>
      <p>
        Our most important goal of our project is to create the Virtual 3D
        interior model. The goal for the interior model is to design a fully
        functional Virtual interior that can be viewed on VR headsets and also
        on PC and mobile without the VR functionality.<br><br> Our goal is to begin with
        developing an example floor plan on Adobe Illustrator which we will use
        for the ‘base’ of our interior design. We then will use that floor plan
        to duplicate it onto Floorplanner and develop the interior. The next
        step is to fully furnish the property and finally render it and make it
        VR compatible.

    <div class="pap">
      <h2>Plan and Progress</h2>
      <p>
        Our project is to design 3D virtual homes and a Virtual Reality headset model for Real Estates that allow the clients to be able to view and experience the interiors in a Virtual Reality headset or on a supported web page on PC or mobile without the need to go to the physical location of the home. We look to target two types of clients, one being people looking to buy property, and the other being people constructing their own property. For the clients buying their property, they are able to view all the different 3D digital models of properties that we have available on our website, and they also have the option of viewing it through their VR headset. On the other hand, clients that are building their property are able to submit their plans, which also includes their interior specifications, upon which we will create a 3D digital model for them, they also will have the option of viewing it through a VR headset.

<br><br>We will achieve our project goal by creating a website demonstrating our headset model and the completed rendered 3D interior models created through floor plans submitted by clients or of pre-made properties. For the creation of the artifacts, we will be using 3 tools. One of them is Blender, for this assignment we will use blender to create the 3D model of the headset we are going to make through which the clients can view their property at their local Real Estate and they can also view it through their own headset if they own one. Despite the digital model being available on any VR headset, the headset we will make has all the files and links connected, thus making it easier for the client to view their property in virtual reality. Another tool we have used is Floorplanner, this is the platform we will be using to make the 3D models of floor plans, including detailed interiors. For the purpose of the prototype, a member of the group has created a sample 2D floorplan, which was then used to make a 3D digital model. Finally, the last tool used to make the artifacts for the assignment was Adobe Illustrator. This software was used to create the 2D floor plan for the 3D modeling which we mentioned before. The combination of this software allowed us to create all the necessary artifacts required for the assignment.
We will do this by using Blender, Floorplanner, and Adobe Illustrator to create our prototype and final artifacts. 

<br><br>The way we have approached this project is by first discussing all the necessary points regarding the idea for the project, which included functionality, design of the interface, and other necessary artifacts which are related to the project. After this we began working on separate components of the assignment, along with that we also began the development of the report website and website prototype. For the report website, we decided to use the template of the one we created for the last assignment, which reduced our workload. In terms of the website prototype, we first started with developing an engaging colour scheme that provided clean visual aesthetics to the application. We also further selected a font that we liked the look of and designed a logo that was fitting for our colour scheme and website design. In terms of the beginning development process of the backend of the website, we developed a design of how we wanted the user to interact with the application including input forms, hamburger menus, and large landing pages. 

<br><br>Our progress during the beginning so far, we have created a prototype model for the VR headset on Blender which will be further developed and add textures to create the final fully rendered design. The floor plan design is almost completed. It is just like a standard home plan that includes bathrooms, 2 bedrooms including master, dining, kitchen, living room, garage, and a study. We need to add in the doors and room names, it is being designed on Adobe Illustrator. We are currently working on the 3D interior model based on the finished sections of the floorplan, completing the final floor plan design, and working on the website. 

<br><br>Our project began with the simple individual idea of creating a Virtual Reality home model that is to be used as a ‘Virtual Holiday’ or an escape from isolation due to covid and where it can also be used for real estates providing them with the option of a virtual house tour for those that are unable to travel which will be viewed from the VR headset that will be created.

<br><br>As our BigBrainSpace group has formed, we have chosen this virtual home idea and progressed through the Real Estate route where we will be creating virtual home replicas to the real properties. 

<br><br>We have changed the original idea where users are able to purchase the Virtual Reality headset created, instead the headset will be developed for the Real Estates and enterprise use were instead targeting the product towards the consumer and having the constraint of the price factor, by creating it for enterprise purposes we are able to focus more on the quality of the VR headset and make it as immersive as possible for better user experience and for the interior design to be indistinguishable from the real interiors, which users can use the VR headset models at their local Real Estates to view the properties. 

<br><br>What puts our VR headset apart from the consumer-based headsets is that our headset has the feature to link straight to the web application with a library of provided floor plans and interior designs for each client and, with the focus of creating the headset for enterprise purposes, it will provide higher graphics and refresh rate (hertz) that in hopes to create the same experience undifferentiated from the physical house tours.

<br><br>This provides options for clients that are unable to travel due to Covid-19 restrictions or who lives a far distance from the property, to be able to go to their local Real Estate and experience the house in full immersion through our VR headset model or they can view it from the comfort of their own home through their own Virtual Reality device or alternatively, through a web browser on PC or mobile device.

<br><br>We further developed our idea by creating a website for real estates where clients are also able to upload their floor plans and we will create a 3D rendered interior model for them. However, they can also view already made interior designs from pre-existing homes which are available for purchase. 

<br><br>For our progress near the end of our project production, we have fully completed the Virtual Reality headset design and completed the final floor plan design. We added the final textures and colours to the VR headset prototype model, scaled the model, ensured the model is close to the physical product, and finally provided lighting, a camera angle, and rendered the digital model for our final VR headset prototype. 

<br><br>With the floor plan, we added in the doors and room names with a border that provided our business name and short information about the floor plan and exported the floor plan. This can be viewed at the beginning of this document. 

<br><br>For the current progress of the 3D interior design, we have completed the 3D floor plan modeling based on our final floor plan and have included furnishing, colour scheme for the rooms and interiors and scaled the house to proportion. To finalize the interior design of the house, we added some furniture according to our desires. The team will finalize the interior design and ensure camera angles are set for a good view of the different rooms and finally render the project. Once the interior designs and camera angles were set, we set a face-to-face meeting during class time to have everything viewed and see if everyone was happy with the final look. After that, minor adjustments were made after the meeting until everyone was satisfied. 

<br><br>The CSS and HTML are currently being finalized and all our project artifacts including the VR headset, final floor plan, and final interior will be displayed on our website that will be used for our clients and Real Estates.  We decided to use Bootstrap 4 and 5 framework with a combination of javascript elements in the design of our end prototype at this stage as we found its flexibility to be increasingly advantageous. Elements that we were able to incorporate into our prototype through the use of javascript and Bootstrap include highly responsive elements such as fluid image resizing and cleaner code, we also added a preloader for page elements and a sticky header with transparent and solid backgrounds allowing for ease of use and user-friendliness. Finally, we decided to incorporate two new features into the application and they were a responsive resizing script through CSS for specific media screen sizes allowing for mobile responsiveness and viewing and also a Bootstrap carousel for team members including their positions/jobs within this application and a thumbnail image.

<br><br>As the due date for this project is only a couple of days away, we have started to finalize all the sections of the report to make sure that all the information has been included, and that no grammatical errors have been made. Members of the team have also started to transfer the information across to the website, and we planned to complete the transfer before Friday of the week this assignment is due. On Friday, we also plan to meet for one last time, to review any changes required within the assignment, and discuss final suggestions which could enhance the project. By reviewing and discussing on Friday, we get a buffer of two days to think of anything else we want to add or if any member remembers anything that could be added to the website or the report. 

<br><br>Along with the report and the website, the prototype is also in its final stages. All the functional elements required for the prototype were made last week, and were added to the prototype website this week. All other components of the prototype were finished in the first two weeks of the project, which includes the interface design things like colour, font, size, positioning of elements within the website, and so on. When we meet on Friday, we will also review the prototype to check for any minor changes that members suggest or that might be required to enhance the look and feel of the prototype. We look to complete 99% of the work before or during the meeting.

<br><br>At the final meeting, the prototype application was finalized along with the report website with all respective information from this report. We performed some final checks on the website prototype including image and text responsiveness in differential viewports as well as input verification and reload times. We also finalized the report website by transferring the last information including reflections into the HTML/CSS.

      <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
      <p>
        Big Brain Space will develop a virtual reality property designer/planner
        for clients, which will include features such as, being able to inspect
        the property while not being present at the location of the property,
        which is made possible by the VR modelling of the property available
        through the VR headset provided.<br><br> Clients that are constructing their
        homes will be able to provide floor plans of their home as well interior
        designs they have chosen for their property such as colour of walls, or
        whether the flooring is tiles or laminate and so on. After this we
        create a digital model of their property, which will also be available
        for viewing through VR headset.<br><br> This is a very big project, as there are
        countless number of properties in Australia, thus we have decided to
        only make one digital model of a residential property, just to showcase
        what the project is about.<br><br> For the VR headset design the users will be
        able to see a 3D rendered digital model instead of a physical model
        currently. There is a limitation with this project when it comes to
        designing the 3D model of ready made properties. The model we make does
        not include any flaws within the property, for example while making the
        digital model of the home, minor damages and flaws will not be taken
        into consideration as not everything can be shown in the digital model.

      <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        The tools used to create the headset model will be ‘Blender’, which is
        free 3D computer graphics software for modelling and animating that can
        render high quality models. The software used to create the interior
        designs will be using the browser-based platform called ‘Floorplanner’.
        <br><br>Floorplanner is a website for people to create interior designs from
        scratch, it is different from our idea as Floorplanner is essentially
        like a simplified CAD software that provides you with the tools to
        create your own designs. The website can create simple VR compatible
        interior designs with full 3D rendered and designed furniture without
        modelling designs from scratch.<br><br> The final rendered designs will be
        showcased on our website which can be accessed using a VR headset or
        with a mobile device or pc. The tools used to create the website include
        the use of software including text editors such as Sublime Text 3 and
        Visual Studio Code.<br><br> These text editors allow us to manipulate and add to
        HTML and CSS files which allow us to populate data and alter styling for
        our website. We also used multiple text editor extensions like Live
        Server which allowed us to see real-time changes within the website
        while we altered the code.<br><br> Furthermore, we also used Github as a host
        for our repository where we stored all the HTML and CSS files and used
        Github Pages to create and host our website through these files.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="tatexp">
      <h2>Group Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Members of the group have previous experience in using text editors such
        as Sublime Text 3, VS code and atom. We have all used one of these to
        create the website for assignment 1.<br><br> Some members of the group have also
        used these text editors in the past for different subjects, and for
        different purposes such as programming. All members have also gained
        experience with Github as it was a requirement for the first assignment.
        <br><br>Two of the group members also have experience with ‘Blender’, as they
        have used it to make small projects at home which is one of the reasons
        we chose to use ‘Blender’.

      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <p>
        For testing the product we will first be creating a prototype/unrendered
        model of the Virtual Reality headset on Blender, we can then modify the
        model and add textures and colours for the final rendered design. For
        the interior 3D designs we will first create a mock floor plan using
        Adobe Illustrator or similar softwares we can then refine the floor plan
        and implement it as the floorplan for the final interior design.<br><br> We will
        also create mock up of the interior designs to develop the colour scheme
        for rooms and furnishings to create the environment of the rooms and to
        ensure user satisfaction of the final design.<br><br> In terms of testing the
        website, we will be making a couple of scenarios which will then be
        given to potential users which include real estate agencies and their
        agents and also property developers and their clients building custom
        homes, to the scenarios.<br><br> There will be key path scenarios, which will
        show the input by users and then the reaction of the website. This will
        be a good way to test features within the prototype, and will also allow
        us to see if there are any flaws within the design or the functionality
        of the website.

      <h2>Risks</h2>
      <p>
        There are risks involved with creating the VR headset model in Blender.
        Blender is a CAD software that requires you to create objects from
        scratch, you will need to have good knowledge to understand how to use
        the software. The risk that comes with Blender is that every shape needs
        to be modelled and rendered with textures.<br><br> Some can be difficult to
        create and apply the textures or colours, Blender itself is also time
        consuming and difficult to learn so it may not be possible to create a
        top quality photorealistic rendered model. Additionally, there are more
        risks involved with the development of the website application. The
        first set of risks appear through the use of class names contained
        within the HTML and CSS code.<br><br> The use of simple class names may lead to
        errors including duplicate class usage for two or more separate elements
        within the website, this can lead to the misuse of data or information
        and an incorrect representation and design on the website. To overcome
        this risk we used detailed and specific class names to uniquely identify
        each element of the website and this allowed us to minimise errors and
        maximise application customization.<br><br> Another risk is the use of the
        Bootstrap 4 framework and how our team members do not know much about
        this tool. This risk can present us with ‘headaches’ when needing to
        edit the code within our application or understand it, but this risk can
        also be overcome by reading through the easy-to-follow documentation on
        Bootstrap's website. Finally another risk contained within our web
        application is the exploitation and misuse of personal data stored from
        partners and clients.<br><br> This is a high level risk as personal information,
        floor plans and models may be accessed and leaked by unauthorised users.
        Data leaks and breaches such as these and the risk as a whole can be
        overcome through the use of secure and tight website security practices,
        offsite data storage and minimal collection of user data. Also allowing
        the website to be monitored in an analyst view by accessing website
        traffic and usage would be effective and protecting against threats and
        overcoming this risk.

      <h2>Group Porcesses and Communications</h2>
      <p>
        Our group will be communicating through Microsoft Teams, Facebook
        Messenger and in class. We will be having at least three meetings a week
        to discuss and plan deadlines, one will be done in class face-to-face
        every Monday and the rest of the meetings will be online in Microsoft
        Teams.<br><br> Before meetings we will be planning schedules on Messenger and
        because not everyone will have the same schedule we will also talk about
        what needs to be done through Messenger. When we have group members that
        do not respond or attend meetings we let them know what they need to
        complete before the deadline through Messenger as normally we will get
        an instant reply due to notifications however, if they still don’t reply
        we will also be contacting the course teacher to alert them that our
        team members are not participating or communicating. At that point, we
        will complete the rest of the unfinished work as a group.
